    <p><center>Small Zoo located beneath Yercaud foothill. Road to zoo few last kms are really worst, but we could see they are going to lay new roads as the process have been already started (better check once before you go).<br>Inside Zoo Plastic items are prohibited, even if you carry them the securities will pack and give you in newspapers or to dustbins. Could see a lonely elephant, birds, fox, crocodiles, sambar deer, monkeys.<br>If you go with kids there is 2 play areas to enjoy around.

    <h3 id="09"><center>1008 Shiva Temple Salem</center></h3><br>
    <center><img src="./assests/1008 shivalingam.jpg" alt="1008 Shiva Temple image" height="200" weight="200"></center>
    <p>TAMILNADU temples have lot of Dravidian culture and art based carvings and are very sacred as well so it was a soulful travel so I recommend a trip to Thai place</p>
    <p><center>We are really excited to see really 1008 lingams in the temple and how it was arranged. We couldn't able to cover all lingams due to sunny climate. You can see one big lingam here. many lingam sinnithis are damaged and not maintained well.</center></p><br>

    <center><img src="./assests/relaince mall.jpg" alt="Mega Reliance Mall image" height="200" weight="200"></center>
    <p><center>This is a compact mall. This hosts a movie hall, clothes stores, ice cream parlours, fast food centres. It`s a small one. The parking space is adequate. The movie hall is also a good place to visit. I believe that the movie hall is the best thing there. This place also hosts a sports shop which is a good one. They also have a footwear shop along with a mega grocery store where one can buy all the items of every day use. Another good thing about the mall is that we can get our parking fee that we pay on entry through a minimum shopping of 200 rupees which is easy to do.</center></p><br>
